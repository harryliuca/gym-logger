description: Commit all changes and push to GitHub to trigger deployment
---

Please commit all current changes with a descriptive commit message and push to GitHub to trigger the Netlify deployment.

When creating the commit message:
- Summarize the main features/changes added
- Keep it concise but descriptive
- Use the standard format with the Claude Code footer

After pushing, confirm that the deployment will be triggered automatically on Netlify.
